# Python Solutions for Project Euler Problems

These solutions are in python and were used to help learn python.

I plan on adding more description for going through the solutions in the future for educational purposes.

Some of these solutions are pretty naive, but they track my progress as a I learned python. I want to come back
and try to speed up the solutions with what I have learned.
